    <!-- at this point in time, the pathfile was wrong. 

     there were 2 about.html files (one in the odin-links directory and another in the pages subdirectory under 
     odin-links)
     
     so when i made the changes in vscode i couldnt see the img src code inside the elements inside of chrome.


     did a lot of troubleshooting asking chatgpt  what could be wrong google etc. finally using terminal and lsing
     found that there were 2 files and thats how i solved it by opening the right file in the right path

     possibly happened while mving the about.html file to pages
